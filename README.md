# Fishermen Game
Natalia VÃ©lez, Kelsey Allen

This git repository contains all files and code for the multi-player, in-person fisherman game, created for the CBMM 2016 Summer School.

## Notable highlights:

* `experiments` contains experiment code and pilot data (see experiments/multipilot_v1/results)
* `model` contains model code. The latest version of the model is in 'Fisherman game - RL model.ipynb'. There are also some simulation results on the folder. Each simulation has a .csv file with results of 1000 iterations of the model, and a .json file explaining the parameters used in that simulation. Look for pairs of .csv and .json files with a matching timestamp.

Pretty self-explanatory! If you want to run your friends on the task, print out the 'action_cards' in the multipilot_v1 folder and go to:
