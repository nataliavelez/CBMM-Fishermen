            <p>Q3: When the fishermen wake up, do they decide together who's fishing and who's clearing the road? <br />

                </select>
            </p>
            <p>Q4: Once each fisherman decides what to do, can they change their mind later in the day?<br />
                <select size="2" name="q4" multiple="">
                    <option value="i">Yes, they can switch between tasks as much as they want.</option>
                    <option value="c">No, each task takes up the whole day.</option>
                </select>
            </p>
            <p>Q5: Does each fisherman know the strength of the other fishermen?<br />
                <select size="2" name="q5" multiple="">
                    <option value="c">Yes.</option>

                </select>
            </p>
            <p>Q6: Can all fishermen see how many trees are blocking the road?

                    <option value="c">Yes.</option>

            <p>Sometimes, the fishermen could have gotten more fish if they had acted differently. We'll show you cases when this happened and you'll judge how much you think a specific fisherman is to blame. </p>
