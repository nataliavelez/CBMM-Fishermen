Clicking on the ‘SUBMIT’ button on the bottom of this page indicates that you are at least 18 years of age, and agree to complete this HIT voluntarily.</p>

        <p>In this HIT, you will be shown 32 concepts for movies. A previous participant has already gone through all of the movies and picked which movies they would rather watch. Your job is to figure out what this person likes!</p>
