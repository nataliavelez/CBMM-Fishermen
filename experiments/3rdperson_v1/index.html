        <p>Carefully read the instructions below, and answer the following questions. NOTE: Please answer ALL the questions to the best of your ability. If your answers indicate that you haven’t watched our stimuli or have read the instructions, we will be unable to accept your response. Thank you for contributing to a better understanding of how the mind works!</p>

        <p class="legal">This HIT is part of a scientific research project conducted by the Social Learning Lab at Stanford and has been approved by the IRB of Stanford University. Your decision to complete this HIT is voluntary. We will only have access to your worker ID and no other information to identify you. The only other information we will have, in addition to your response, is the time at which you completed the survey and the amount of time you spent to complete it. The results of the research may be presented at scientific meetings or published in scientific journals. Clicking on the ‘SUBMIT’ button on the bottom of this page indicates that you are at least 18 years of age, and agree to complete this HIT voluntarily.</p>

        <p>TO-DO: (1) Write instructions, (2) Replace SLL IRB text with CoCoLab IRB text, (3) Get CoCoLab logo for header?</p>

        <p>The HIT should take 2-3 minutes. Please pay attention. Thanks!</p>
